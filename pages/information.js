    <div class="section"></div>
    <h2 className={`${styles.heading} ${styles.header}`}>Training:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Astronaut candidate training: If you are chosen as an astronaut candidate, you will go through a two-year rigorous training program at the Cassiopeia Space Center in Atlanta, Georgia. This training consists of classroom work, simulations, and physical fitness exercises.</li>
            <li>Basic training: The first year of astronaut candidate training consists of basic training in spacewalking, robotics, and spacecraft systems. Candidates learn about the International Space Station (ISS) and get hands-on experience living and working in microgravity.</li>
            <li>Advanced training: The second year of training is more mission-specific in nature. Astronaut candidates are trained in the specific skills required for their upcoming mission, which may include spacewalking, spacecraft piloting, and scientific equipment operation.</li>
            <li>Additional training: After being assigned to a mission, astronauts receive additional training tailored to that mission. Language and culture training, medical training, and training on the specific scientific experiments they will be conducting are all possibilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section"></div>
    <h2 className={`${styles.heading} ${styles.header}`}>Safety</h2>
    <p>When it comes to space exploration, astronaut safety is of the utmost importance, and it is the responsibility of both space agencies and private space companies to ensure that their astronauts are well-protected and prepared for any challenges they may face. Cassiopeia Space recognizes the importance of astronaut safety and has put safeguards in place to keep our astronauts as safe as possible during their missions.</p>
    <p>Cassiopeia Space ensures astronaut safety in a variety of ways, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Robust training: Before any astronaut is sent on a mission, they must go through a rigorous training program designed to prepare them for the challenges of spaceflight. Our training program includes simulated space missions, emergency drills, and other activities that help astronauts prepare for a variety of situations in space.</li>
        <li>Advanced Technology: Cassiopeia Space employs cutting-edge technology to design and build spacecraft that are as safe and reliable as possible. Our spacecraft are outfitted with cutting-edge life support, communication, and other safety features to keep our astronauts safe.</li>
        <li>Comprehensive risk management: We have a dedicated team of risk management experts at Cassiopeia Space who assess and manage potential risks associated with spaceflight. Our team works to identify potential hazards and implement mitigation measures to keep our astronauts safe.</li>
        <li>Contingency planning: Despite our best efforts, there is always the possibility that something unexpected will occur during a space mission. We have contingency plans in place at Cassiopeia Space for a variety of scenarios, including medical emergencies, equipment malfunctions, and other unexpected events.</li>
        <p>In addition to these precautions, Cassiopeia Space is dedicated to the safety of its astronauts by abiding by all applicable safety laws and standard operating procedures. We are aware of the risks associated with space travel and take all reasonable safety measures to protect our astronauts.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2 className={`${styles.heading} ${styles.header}`}>Recovery</h2>
    <p>A crucial aspect of safeguarding the safety and wellbeing of astronauts is guaranteeing their recuperation after a space mission. Cassiopeia Space, a space corporation, is aware of the significance of a carefully thought-out and carried-out astronaut recovery process. Here is a quick summary of how we manage astronaut recovery:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preparation and preparation: Prior to the launch of a space mission, we develop a comprehensive recovery plan that outlines the steps and tools needed for a safe and efficient recovery. This includes planning for the landing or splashdown site, the type of recovery vehicle required, and the people required for the recovery crew.</li>
        <li>Communication and tracking: We maintain constant contact with the astronauts throughout the mission to ensure that we are always aware of their whereabouts and conditions. We use tracking devices to keep track of the spacecraft's position and trajectory, and we communicate with the crew using cutting-edge communication technologies.</li>
        <li>Landing or splashdown: Once the mission is completed, we work with the appropriate organizations to ensure a safe and timely landing or splashdown of the spacecraft. We have trained recovery teams on standby to deploy immediately to the landing or splashdown site. </li>
        <li>Recovery operations: After the spacecraft has touched down or splashed down, the recovery team moves in to retrieve the astronauts and the spacecraft. The astronauts are safely extracted from the spacecraft using specialized recovery equipment and trucks, and they are then transported to a medical facility for examination and, if necessary, treatment.</li>
        <li>Medical evaluation and debriefing: Once the astronauts have recovered, they are thoroughly examined to ensure that they are in good health and have not developed any medical problems as a result of their space flight. We also give the astronauts a debriefing session to help them absorb their experience and offer suggestions for how to improve future missions.</li>
    <p>Overall, recovering astronauts is a difficult and important procedure that must be meticulously planned, coordinated, and executed. Our astronauts' safety and well-being are a top priority at Cassiopeia Space, where we have developed dependable recuperation processes.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>Launch costs can vary greatly depending on the type of spacecraft, location, size, and complexity of the mission. In general, the cost of launching a spacecraft can range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, with larger, more complex missions costing billions.</p>
    <p>Cassiopeia Space understands that the cost of space travel may be a significant barrier for many people. In the future, we hope to make space travel accessible and affordable to the general public.</p>
    <p>Cassiopeia Space is currently looking into the idea of offering spaceflight packages that include training, lodging, and other services to make frequent civilian space travel easier and less expensive. These packages would be designed to provide a rich and distinct experience that is affordable to a larger group of people. </p>
    <p>We are committed to making space travel more accessible and affordable for everyone, even though we are unable to disclose specific pricing for these spaceflight bundles at this time. Because we believe that space is for everyone, we aim to create a future in which ordinary citizens can explore space and personally encounter the wonders of the cosmos.</p>
    <p>Overall, Cassiopeia Space is committed to researching solutions to reduce the cost of space travel while acknowledging that launching a spacecraft can be extremely costly. We are excited about the future potential of space travel and are committed to making it a reality for as many people as possible.</p>
